I need to create a dataset for a natural language processing task and the dataset needs to be labeled. Since the labeling process is time-consuming and very costly, before I actually create the dataset, I need to evaluate the expected quality of my data labeling process by conducting a feasibility study. If the labeling process introduces unwanted randomness or noise, I need a method to clean these labels.  Since we will be training machine learning models on this dataset, I also need a way to estimate the expected performances of these machine learning models, possibly using the expected quality of my dataset as an indicator. In addition, I need to estimate how much these processes cost.

In machine translation tasks, when the source and target languages contain sentences of vastly different levels of complexity, many neural machine translation models do not perform as well. For example, if I want to translate very technical medical documents in English to more colloquial and simpler explanations in Swahili, current translation models do not work well.

Though data augmentation can be effective to improve model's performances, for natural language models, data augmentation can also cause noises in model’s output such as prediction or machine translation. My research fields involve training models for text classification, question answering and sequence labeling, all of which could benefit from using augmented dataset. It is important for me to understand how data augmentations could cause noises in predictions. I want to identify what augmentation technique could cause noises in prediction, so I should perform a sensitivity analysis. Overall, I want to penalize the model if there are too much noises in the output due to data augmentation.

I want to build a customer service chatbot that can understand and respond to complex inquiries from customers. For my purposes, I assume the complexity in inquiries come from having multiple intents and slots in a single utterance. Therefore I need a model that can detect intent and fill slots, jointly. The model needs to have fast inference speed, and need to avoid introducing unseen data when restructuring the customer’s inquiry. Therefore I should look into how to make my model faster during inference and avoid information leakage. My current idea is to leverage the interaction between multiple intents and slots in an utterance. These intents and slots are unlabelled, which makes them uncoordinated and more challenging.

I am a medical researcher working towards Melanoma Detection. My dataset consists of patients’ skin images. I want to build a system that can automatically find the regions where melanoma is likely to occur. Skin lesions are usually places where melanoma would occur, but most areas of skin lesions do not cause melanoma, so I really need to pinpoint the exact locations where melanoma could occur.

However, I have difficulties determining the surface of the object because of the features of the polarization camera. I need a model that can analyze the angle of polarization of reflected light in captured images. I think both geometric and photometric cues extracted from input color polarization images should be utilized to complete the analysis.

As a professional game player, I am interested in reinforcement learning algorithms.

I want to build a healthcare decision support system that will recommend treatment plans for patients. In order to make the prediction process transparent and interpretable, I believe I could use reinforcement learning. Given the patient’s past medical history, I will spawn many processes, in each process an artificial or digital twin for the patient is spawned to mimic the patient’s health trajectories. In each process, the patient will receive many treatments, prescriptions, surgeries, and will experience a rest and recovery period, and eventually some form of complications or disease will terminate the patient, and thus terminate the process as well.

As a data scientist, I am currently developing an early detection system designed to identify the onset of progressive neurodegenerative diseases through the analysis of brain scans. My current dataset consists of a large volume of unlabeled data, supplemented by a limited number of labeled positive examples. My goal is to create a model that can effectively learn from this data to ensure accurate detection.

I am currently developing an application that can efficiently search for images relevant to given text descriptions by integrating both visual and textual data. Although current state-of-the-art pre-trained models are effective, they are limited by slow inference speeds and substantial computational costs.

I am currently involved in a project that aims to improve the safety and efficiency of self-driving cars by predicting the paths of surrounding objects in urban driving situations. Current methods, such as multimodal regression and occupancy maps, have shown limitations in accurately predicting an object’s path. My plan is to treat trajectory prediction as a ranking task, sorting through the set of all potential paths. I need algorithms that can generate a diverse set of potential paths, accommodating a wide range of situations while concurrently discarding paths that are physically unfeasible. To enhance this method, I plan to generate these path sets based on the vehicle's current situation. For example, when the vehicle is on a highway, the model should not generate paths for objects on the roadside. I am also interested in integrating real-time traffic data and weather conditions into the model to increase its accuracy.

In our security company, we often deal with low-resolution images of faces captured from surveillance cameras, which makes it difficult to identify individuals accurately. We are looking for a solution that can generate high-resolution face images from these low-resolution inputs, especially when the input resolution is extremely low (e.g., only several hundred pixels) and the images are captured under uncontrolled settings with large pose and illumination variations.

I am seeking to develop a method that yields a range of promising output candidates rather than a single solution, a concept known as conformal prediction, in scenarios where data availability for the target task is limited. I need a model capable of automatically analyzing task features and identifying similar tasks with sufficiently available training data. This model should then discern the differences between tasks and transfer knowledge from similar tasks to new ones. It should also retain the candidate that the user ultimately selects, storing this data under the new task for future reference.

I am seeking a generative modeling approach capable of creating new levels and potentially game settings/environments for a video game with multiple existing levels of difficulty. Specifically, I am interested in exploring how Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and other generative methods could generate entirely new levels by emulating the style of previous ones.

As a healthcare organization, our goal is to create a system that can effectively extract crucial information from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to enhance patient care and medical research. Given the challenge of limited labeled data in EHRs, we intend to utilize transfer learning and cross-lingual methods to train a model for this task.

In the context of time series forecasting, it's observed that anomalies in certain data sources, such as seismic activity, heart rate monitors, and nuclear plant cooling system temperatures, occur infrequently but often result in catastrophic outcomes like earthquakes, heart attacks, and nuclear meltdowns. My objective is to devise a time series forecasting model capable of predicting these rare anomalies with high precision. This model must be equipped to manage extremely sparse supervised signals. To train my model effectively, I believe it's necessary to employ some form of sampling or bootstrapping to simulate various event pathways leading to these anomalies. Essentially, this involves data augmentation to generate more positive signals for training. Consequently, I require a simulation agent capable of learning the underlying time series data distribution. This simulation agent (model) must also be generative to create new pathways and simulate new events. I propose that the simulation agent should incorporate a reinforcement learning component. However, I am open to any literature that discusses rare event simulation, regardless of whether the method is statistical or deep learning-based. Ultimately, I am confident that my model will be robust enough for deployment in real-world scenarios for disaster prevention and early warning systems.

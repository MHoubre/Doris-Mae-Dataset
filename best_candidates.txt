I aim to develop a reinforcement learning framework that utilizes human feedback as sparse reward signals.
This framework will have the capacity to incorporate any model for a variety of potential downstream tasks, such as a generative model for art creation or a chatbot for customer service.
The unique aspect of my framework is its ability to apply reinforcement learning to adjust and optimize the behavior of any downstream model based on various forms of human feedback, such as user satisfaction or the model's adherence to ethical standards.
I understand that obtaining a large amount of human feedback data may be challenging, so my framework needs to be capable of learning from sparse and limited human feedback data.
I am interested in finding out if there has been any previous work in this area.
Furthermore, I would like to know if a reinforcement learning algorithm would still function effectively when the supervised human feedback data is scarce.

One of the limiting factors in training data-driven, rare-event prediction
algorithms is the scarcity of the events of interest resulting in an extreme
imbalance in the data. There have been many methods introduced in the
literature for overcoming this issue; simple data manipulation through
undersampling and oversampling, utilizing cost-sensitive learning algorithms,
or by generating synthetic data points following the distribution of the
existing data. While synthetic data generation has recently received a great
deal of attention, there are real challenges involved in doing so for
high-dimensional data such as multivariate time series. In this study, we
explore the usefulness of the conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN)
as a means to perform data-informed oversampling in order to balance a large
dataset of multivariate time series. We utilize a flare forecasting benchmark
dataset, named SWAN-SF, and design two verification methods to both
quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the similarity between the generated
minority and the ground-truth samples. We further assess the quality of the
generated samples by training a classical, supervised machine learning
algorithm on synthetic data, and testing the trained model on the unseen, real
data. The results show that the classifier trained on the data augmented with
the synthetic multivariate time series achieves a significant improvement
compared with the case where no augmentation is used. The popular flare
forecasting evaluation metrics, TSS and HSS, report 20-fold and 5-fold
improvements, respectively, indicating the remarkable statistical similarities,
and the usefulness of CGAN-based data generation for complicated tasks such as
flare forecasting.

I am working on a natural language processing project focused on entity recognition, which necessitates the comprehension and processing of vast amounts of text data.
My goal is to integrate real-world knowledge during the training phase to bolster the model's performance across various tasks, thus bridging the gap between raw text and meaningful entities.
Therefore, I am in search of models that can generate and learn embeddings for words and entities by leveraging extensive real-world knowledge bases.
Naturally, the model needs to be able to process knowledge and concept in some differentiable way.
Ideally, the trained model should excel in performance on entity-centric datasets and produce competitive results on other standard benchmark datasets.

I aim to enhance the expressive power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to differentiate between graphs that are structurally different but possess the same local neighborhood structure, a task they traditionally struggle with.
To achieve this, I plan to develop structure-related features that can aid GNNs in representing any set of nodes, thereby increasing their expressive power.
Could you suggest some standard graph-distance measures, such as the shortest path distance, that could be used to capture the distance between the node set and each individual node in the graph?
Furthermore, I want these features to enhance the ability of GNN nodes to gather information from neighboring nodes for self-updating.
Importantly, these features should leverage the sparse structure of the underlying graph, ensuring computational efficiency and scalability.
Finally, I intend to demonstrate the advantages of my proposed features by testing them on standard network tasks, such as structural role prediction.
Could you also suggest other tasks where these features could be tested?

It is understood that training-based models can potentially discriminate against individuals in underrepresented minority demographics.
Consequently, I am keen to ensure that machine learning and deep learning models do not foster unfair representations of minority groups.
This could be achieved either by introducing constraints during training or by eliminating discriminatory behaviors during model inference.
Specifically, I am interested in identifying datasets where a traditionally trained model could exhibit discriminatory behavior.
I am also seeking to understand specific terminologies and concepts related to this field of study.
Moreover, I am looking for comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that can help determine the fairness of a model.
My current hypothesis is that if we can pinpoint the decision boundary of a neural model, we can identify where discrimination occurs.
If we can then adjust or modify this decision boundary, we can retroactively correct such discriminatory behaviors in models.
Ultimately, my goal is to develop machine learning algorithms that are not only accurate but also fair and transparent in their treatment of protected groups.

Specifically, I am interested in exploring how Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and other generative methods could generate entirely new levels by emulating the style of previous ones.
It is crucial that the newly generated levels are not merely derivative and that my generative model can optimize specific properties, such as the intensity or graphic nature of the game.
Given that these properties are non-differentiable, I need a method to either render them differentiable or employ a reinforcement learning-centric approach to optimize these rewards.
After generating a variety of levels, I require a method to select some of the best ones.
One potential solution could be to evaluate the generated levels using an automatic metric, such as the performance of an AI agent playing the level.
Alternatively, I am considering designing a derivative-free stochastic optimization algorithm to guide the search across the space of all synthetically generated levels, steering towards those that meet specific objectives.

I am currently engaged in a project that involves compressing High Dynamic Range (HDR) images to be compatible with older JPEG formats.
I have found that the existing JPEG XT standard, which is designed to support high dynamic range imaging, does not fully accommodate HDR images.
Consequently, I am in need of a model that can convert HDR images into a JPEG XT version with minimal loss of information.
I am interested in learning how to incorporate image compression methods into this task.
My objective is to develop a universal model that can effectively handle this task without the need to find the optimal setting for each individual image.
I am seeking guidance on how to design and train such a model, including the selection of appropriate training data and suitable performance metrics.
I anticipate that a neural network-based compression algorithm could potentially outperform traditional algorithms.
Therefore, I would appreciate any insights into the compression methods based on CNN, autoencoders, or GANs.

One of the limiting factors in training data-driven, rare-event prediction
algorithms is the scarcity of the events of interest resulting in an extreme
imbalance in the data. There have been many methods introduced in the
literature for overcoming this issue; simple data manipulation through
undersampling and oversampling, utilizing cost-sensitive learning algorithms,
or by generating synthetic data points following the distribution of the
existing data. While synthetic data generation has recently received a great
deal of attention, there are real challenges involved in doing so for
high-dimensional data such as multivariate time series. In this study, we
explore the usefulness of the conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN)
as a means to perform data-informed oversampling in order to balance a large
dataset of multivariate time series. We utilize a flare forecasting benchmark
dataset, named SWAN-SF, and design two verification methods to both
quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the similarity between the generated
minority and the ground-truth samples. We further assess the quality of the

I am working for a social media platform and my task is to automatically generate captions for user-uploaded images so that overall user experience is enhanced.
I know that computer vision models can effectively do image captioning but for similar images they tend to give out the same vanilla and bland descriptions.
I need to be building a model that could introduce diversity into the process of image captioning.
I want my model to be able to  generate distinct captions for similar images.
Some ideas that I have so far include: using a customized weighted loss function so that the model will be penalized for bland descriptions.
Secondly, use reinforcement learning and treat diversity as reward in the training process.
Thirdly, I could also group similar images together as a training bundle.
I also need some new metrics to evaluate the distinctiveness of the captions.
Finally, I would like my model to outperform state-of-the-art image captioning models in terms of diversity with minimal degradation in accuracy.

My research fields involve training models for text classification, question answering and sequence labeling, all of which could benefit from using augmented dataset.
It is important for me to understand how data augmentations could cause noises in predictions.
I want to identify what augmentation technique could cause noises in prediction, so I should perform a sensitivity analysis.
Overall, I want to penalize the model if there are too much noises in the output due to data augmentation.

Initially, I require a method to swiftly generate examples of adversarial attacks.

My current approach involves implementing some form of regularization to ensure that MAML is not disproportionately influenced by a handful of malicious data examples.
Given that MAML can perform parameter updates in either its inner or outer loop, it is crucial for me to determine the optimal location to deploy these defense strategies, such as regularization.

I am currently involved in a project that aims to improve the safety and efficiency of self-driving cars by predicting the paths of surrounding objects in urban driving situations.

My plan is to treat trajectory prediction as a ranking task, sorting through the set of all potential paths.
I need algorithms that can generate a diverse set of potential paths, accommodating a wide range of situations while concurrently discarding paths that are physically unfeasible.
To enhance this method, I plan to generate these path sets based on the vehicle's current situation.
For example, when the vehicle is on a highway, the model should not generate paths for objects on the roadside.
I am also interested in integrating real-time traffic data and weather conditions into the model to increase its accuracy.
Lastly, I aim to validate my novel approach using real-world autonomous vehicle data and compare its performance with existing trajectory prediction models.

I am currently developing an application that can efficiently search for images relevant to given text descriptions by integrating both visual and textual data.
Although current state-of-the-art pre-trained models are effective, they are limited by slow inference speeds and substantial computational costs.
These limitations are primarily due to the attention mechanisms in the Transformer architecture, making them impractical for real-world applications where low latency and computational efficiency are crucial.
Consequently, I am seeking a solution that can enhance inference speeds without sacrificing model accuracy.
One potential approach is to represent texts and images in a structured, easily searchable embedding format.
This format should remain a vectorized embedding but could incorporate certain structures that facilitate faster search and ranking.
All these processes should be conducted offline, and during online inference, only highly efficient cosine similarity matching should be performed from their embeddings.
Ultimately, my goal is for this solution to outperform existing pre-trained models in both speed and accuracy across various image and text retrieval benchmarks.

One of the limiting factors in training data-driven, rare-event prediction
algorithms is the scarcity of the events of interest resulting in an extreme
imbalance in the data. There have been many methods introduced in the
literature for overcoming this issue; simple data manipulation through
undersampling and oversampling, utilizing cost-sensitive learning algorithms,
or by generating synthetic data points following the distribution of the
existing data. While synthetic data generation has recently received a great
deal of attention, there are real challenges involved in doing so for
high-dimensional data such as multivariate time series. In this study, we
explore the usefulness of the conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN)
as a means to perform data-informed oversampling in order to balance a large
dataset of multivariate time series. We utilize a flare forecasting benchmark
dataset, named SWAN-SF, and design two verification methods to both
quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the similarity between the generated
minority and the ground-truth samples. We further assess the quality of the
generated samples by training a classical, supervised machine learning
algorithm on synthetic data, and testing the trained model on the unseen, real

the synthetic multivariate time series achieves a significant improvement

We are making a film, in which I need to project a real person’s facial expression to a virtual character.
I am planning to develop a system for facial and head reenactment that can seamlessly transfer facial expressions, head pose, and eye gaze from a source video to a target subject in nearly real-time speed.
I first need a model that can accurately track facial expressions, head pose and eye gaze from a source video.
I hope the model has very high accuracy supported by test results.
Then, I plan to develop a deep learning model that can analyze 3D geometry of faces and modify facial attributes.
I heard GANs are good for these tasks so references from GANs can be very helpful.

Because there are so many variables and physical processes involved in the formation of cyclones, I want my model to take into account the complex environmental processes and take into account how these complexities would affect the confidence interval of the final predictions.
My current idea is to use a machine learning algorithm that can serve as an estimator for conditional distribution.
The model should not use any blackbox model, since I will need to be able to interpret the final prediction.
Afterwards, the predicted behaviors of cyclones must be analyzed to provide extra insight into how cyclones are formed and how they grow in intensity.
I want to look more into machine learning algorithms with proposed sampling approximations.
Finally, I will gather relevant data and information from tropical cyclones in the Atlantic region.

One of the limiting factors in training data-driven, rare-event prediction
algorithms is the scarcity of the events of interest resulting in an extreme
imbalance in the data. There have been many methods introduced in the
literature for overcoming this issue; simple data manipulation through
undersampling and oversampling, utilizing cost-sensitive learning algorithms,
or by generating synthetic data points following the distribution of the
existing data. While synthetic data generation has recently received a great
deal of attention, there are real challenges involved in doing so for
high-dimensional data such as multivariate time series. In this study, we
explore the usefulness of the conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN)
as a means to perform data-informed oversampling in order to balance a large
dataset of multivariate time series. We utilize a flare forecasting benchmark
dataset, named SWAN-SF, and design two verification methods to both
quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the similarity between the generated
minority and the ground-truth samples. We further assess the quality of the
generated samples by training a classical, supervised machine learning
algorithm on synthetic data, and testing the trained model on the unseen, real
data. The results show that the classifier trained on the data augmented with
the synthetic multivariate time series achieves a significant improvement
compared with the case where no augmentation is used. The popular flare
forecasting evaluation metrics, TSS and HSS, report 20-fold and 5-fold

I work in the field of medical text mining and I require a system that can accurately extract relevant information from medical documents.
First of all, the system needs a named entity recognition module that is capable of recognizing biomedical entities.
I am currently thinking about using deep learning based approaches for the named entity recognition module, so I can achieve optimal performance.
However, since human annotations are expensive and difficult to obtain, I want to explore options where my deep learning module does not need much labeled data, instead, it could train on unlabeled data as well.
Since in real-life, there is a large volume of medical documents, I want to reduce the amount of training time.
Currently, I think I could use some weight sharing or weight transfer to reduce training time.
My final goal is to beat current state of the art models as well as pre-trained models.
Overall, efficiency and low-cost are two important factors in my data collection, model training and inference pipeline.

I need to create a dataset for a natural language processing task and the dataset needs to be labeled.
Since the labeling process is time-consuming and very costly, before I actually create the dataset, I need to evaluate the expected quality of my data labeling process by conducting a feasibility study.
If the labeling process introduces unwanted randomness or noise, I need a method to clean these labels.
Since we will be training machine learning models on this dataset, I also need a way to estimate the expected performances of these machine learning models, possibly using the expected quality of my dataset as an indicator.
In addition, I need to estimate how much these processes cost.

I am currently working on a project that involves transforming black-and-white videos into colored versions, with a particular focus on color propagation in videos.
I have found that traditional methods of color propagation tend to be computationally demanding.
Therefore, I am seeking a more efficient method, especially when additional video information is available.
I am interested in a model that can utilize a set of colored key frames from the video and apply color propagation algorithms to colorize other frames based on the provided colored ones.
Ideally, this method should incorporate both local and global strategies.
The local strategies should ensure color consistency in neighboring regions and frames, thereby maintaining stable color propagation.
Simultaneously, from a global perspective, the model should be capable of identifying the keyframes that require colorization, ensuring overall process efficiency.
While I value the efficiency of the color propagation methods, I am willing to compromise on quality, provided the performance surpasses the baselines established within the past five years.

One of the limiting factors in training data-driven, rare-event prediction
algorithms is the scarcity of the events of interest resulting in an extreme
imbalance in the data. There have been many methods introduced in the
literature for overcoming this issue; simple data manipulation through
undersampling and oversampling, utilizing cost-sensitive learning algorithms,
or by generating synthetic data points following the distribution of the
existing data. While synthetic data generation has recently received a great
deal of attention, there are real challenges involved in doing so for
high-dimensional data such as multivariate time series. In this study, we
explore the usefulness of the conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN)
as a means to perform data-informed oversampling in order to balance a large
dataset of multivariate time series. We utilize a flare forecasting benchmark
dataset, named SWAN-SF, and design two verification methods to both
quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the similarity between the generated
minority and the ground-truth samples. We further assess the quality of the
generated samples by training a classical, supervised machine learning
algorithm on synthetic data, and testing the trained model on the unseen, real
data. The results show that the classifier trained on the data augmented with
the synthetic multivariate time series achieves a significant improvement
compared with the case where no augmentation is used. The popular flare
forecasting evaluation metrics, TSS and HSS, report 20-fold and 5-fold
improvements, respectively, indicating the remarkable statistical similarities,
and the usefulness of CGAN-based data generation for complicated tasks such as
flare forecasting.

In our security company, we often deal with low-resolution images of faces captured from surveillance cameras, which makes it difficult to identify individuals accurately.
We are looking for a solution that can generate high-resolution face images from these low-resolution inputs, especially when the input resolution is extremely low (e.g., only several hundred pixels) and the images are captured under uncontrolled settings with large pose and illumination variations.
We hope the solution is based on a deep learning framework that can efficiently utilize global and local constraints defining a face.
It would be beneficial if the framework had the following 2-step processes: one for holistic face reconstruction according to global constraints and another for enhancing face-specific details and enforcing local patch statistics.
Additionally, we would like the deep network to be optimized using a loss function for super-resolution that combines reconstruction error with a learned face quality measured in an adversarial setting, resulting in robust visual results.
We are interested in a solution that has been extensively tested in both controlled and uncontrolled setups and has demonstrated improvements over the current state of the art.

When modeling complex probability distributions of variables with inherent dependencies, I utilize a graph to represent these dependencies and probabilistic models to depict the variables' distributions.
However, these models can be large and computationally expensive during inference.
Therefore, I am seeking a fast, approximate inference algorithm that can access a highly effective proposal distribution for importance sampling.
My current strategy involves identifying non-essential variables and marginalizing them during sampling to enhance the speed of inference.
Additionally, I am considering transforming the graphical model into a more efficient format, such as a decision diagram, to facilitate easier interpretation during sampling (inference).
To evaluate the effectiveness of my approach, I need to test it against standard benchmarks.
Therefore, I would appreciate information on the standard benchmarks applicable to this task.

imbalance in the data. There have been many methods introduced in the
literature for overcoming this issue; simple data manipulation through
undersampling and oversampling, utilizing cost-sensitive learning algorithms,
or by generating synthetic data points following the distribution of the
existing data. While synthetic data generation has recently received a great

high-dimensional data such as multivariate time series. In this study, we
explore the usefulness of the conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN)
as a means to perform data-informed oversampling in order to balance a large
dataset of multivariate time series. We utilize a flare forecasting benchmark
dataset, named SWAN-SF, and design two verification methods to both
quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the similarity between the generated
minority and the ground-truth samples. We further assess the quality of the
generated samples by training a classical, supervised machine learning
algorithm on synthetic data, and testing the trained model on the unseen, real
data. The results show that the classifier trained on the data augmented with
the synthetic multivariate time series achieves a significant improvement
compared with the case where no augmentation is used. The popular flare
forecasting evaluation metrics, TSS and HSS, report 20-fold and 5-fold
improvements, respectively, indicating the remarkable statistical similarities,

I aim to develop a comprehensive fake news detection system capable of identifying and curbing the spread of misinformation.
The system should be adaptable enough to detect fake news across various domains, such as tracking misinformation related to COVID-19 on social media platforms.
Given the multimedia nature of news, the system should incorporate an automatic speech recognition module, an image (video) processing module, and a language model, among other potential components.
It would be beneficial to convert audio recognition into transcripts and image and video processing into natural language descriptions, necessitating the design of a robust language model.
Additionally, I am keen to explore the dynamics of large-scale information dissemination, which I hope to address by my proposed fake news detection system.

In the context of time series forecasting, it's observed that anomalies in certain data sources, such as seismic activity, heart rate monitors, and nuclear plant cooling system temperatures, occur infrequently but often result in catastrophic outcomes like earthquakes, heart attacks, and nuclear meltdowns.
My objective is to devise a time series forecasting model capable of predicting these rare anomalies with high precision.
This model must be equipped to manage extremely sparse supervised signals.
To train my model effectively, I believe it's necessary to employ some form of sampling or bootstrapping to simulate various event pathways leading to these anomalies.
Essentially, this involves data augmentation to generate more positive signals for training.
Consequently, I require a simulation agent capable of learning the underlying time series data distribution.
This simulation agent (model) must also be generative to create new pathways and simulate new events.
I propose that the simulation agent should incorporate a reinforcement learning component.
However, I am open to any literature that discusses rare event simulation, regardless of whether the method is statistical or deep learning-based.
Ultimately, I am confident that my model will be robust enough for deployment in real-world scenarios for disaster prevention and early warning systems.

In a straightforward manner, I could annotate a diverse set of fully labeled objects, textures and scene layouts, all of which are contaminated by noises to some extent.
Then the agent will be trained with varying levels of augmentations.
Moreover, I would like my model to be structured enough so that I could interpret the effects of introducing noises and transforms to the model’s input.

In addition, I want my model to recognize geometric invariants in images even if they are corrupted by noises and perturbed by circumstances.

The transformer-based model should be capable of inferring from the context and dialogue to predict a character's potential mood and anticipate their next line.
The RL framework will then compare the predicted conversation with the actual conversation in the reward formula to provide weak self-supervision during the training process.
I am aware of the concept of a warm start in training, but I am unsure how to adapt this to my current project.
Furthermore, the target narrative contexts, such as scripts, differ from typical texts, so I would appreciate advice on the appropriate length for the context window in this type of text.
Finally, the model should be able to map mood or personality to facial expressions or character appearances to provide guidance to the actors.

These systems employ an integrated knowledge base, structured similarly to a database, with relational dependencies among various concepts and pre-existing answers.
They interpret user queries and retrieve answers by leveraging the dependencies between concept nodes within the knowledge base.
I am interested in employing a deep neural network to model this type of knowledge base, thereby eliminating the need for hard-coded, rule-based relationships between concepts.
I am curious to see if such a neural network model could overcome the limitations inherent in rule-based knowledge base models.
This is because all relationships and dependencies would have implicit vectorized representations, potentially enhancing computational efficiency.
This approach might also augment the model's expressiveness and capacity to answer more complex questions.
My goal is to demonstrate, using Q&A datasets, that my proposed model outperforms traditional Q&A models in terms of increased accuracy and faster runtime.

Moreover, the model needs to be parameter-efficient to facilitate deployment on compact wearable devices.
It should also be capable of managing long-distance context and grammar dependencies within paragraphs.
My current approach involves using a form of hierarchical decoding.
This method initially translates larger and longer word or phrase-level information swiftly, then fine-tunes subword or even character-level information with greater precision.
My model needs to reach state-of-the-art performance on standard machine translation datasets.

One of the limiting factors in training data-driven, rare-event prediction
algorithms is the scarcity of the events of interest resulting in an extreme
imbalance in the data. There have been many methods introduced in the
literature for overcoming this issue; simple data manipulation through
undersampling and oversampling, utilizing cost-sensitive learning algorithms,
or by generating synthetic data points following the distribution of the
existing data. While synthetic data generation has recently received a great
deal of attention, there are real challenges involved in doing so for
high-dimensional data such as multivariate time series. In this study, we
explore the usefulness of the conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN)
as a means to perform data-informed oversampling in order to balance a large
dataset of multivariate time series. We utilize a flare forecasting benchmark
dataset, named SWAN-SF, and design two verification methods to both
quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the similarity between the generated
minority and the ground-truth samples. We further assess the quality of the
generated samples by training a classical, supervised machine learning
algorithm on synthetic data, and testing the trained model on the unseen, real
data. The results show that the classifier trained on the data augmented with
the synthetic multivariate time series achieves a significant improvement
compared with the case where no augmentation is used. The popular flare
forecasting evaluation metrics, TSS and HSS, report 20-fold and 5-fold
improvements, respectively, indicating the remarkable statistical similarities,

As a data scientist, I am currently developing an early detection system designed to identify the onset of progressive neurodegenerative diseases through the analysis of brain scans.
My current dataset consists of a large volume of unlabeled data, supplemented by a limited number of labeled positive examples.
My goal is to create a model that can effectively learn from this data to ensure accurate detection.
Rather than relying solely on importance reweighting during the model training phase, I am aiming to create a self-learning model.
This would involve the model setting its own learning pace, determining its own loss, and gaining insights from its own performance during the training process.
As such, the incorporation of some form of reinforcement learning might be necessary.
If I go down the route of using RL, given the nature of my dataset, I am particularly interested in reinforcement learning algorithms for hyperparameter selection that can learn from sparse reward signals.
Ultimately, my goal is for my trained model to outperform other methods when applied to specific datasets related to progressive neurodegenerative diseases, particularly those containing brain images.

I find that the primary constraint in modern artificial intelligence applications is the computational resources expended on multilayer perceptrons (MLP) within neural networks.
To enhance the efficiency of MLP, I am seeking a method to distill MLP by eliminating non-essential weights.
To accomplish this, I require a theoretical understanding of the weights in shallow MLPs and an empirical application of these theories to deeper neural networks.
Furthermore, I need a metric that takes into account both the computational resources saved and the performance loss resulting from the distillation.
I understand that the concept of sparsity could be beneficial in representing the number of edges in a graph, but I need guidance on how to apply this concept to MLPs, which can be viewed as a specific type of graph.

In machine translation tasks, when the source and target languages contain sentences of vastly different levels of complexity, many neural machine translation models do not perform as well.
For example, if I want to translate very technical medical documents in English to more colloquial and simpler explanations in Swahili, current translation models do not work well.
To address this issue, I am looking to develop tools that can simplify complex sentences in a parallel fashion.
I also want to develop a neural machine translation tool that considers the difference in text complexity levels between the source and target language of a translation corpus.
Of course, since we cannot humanly annotate the level of difficulty for each sentence, I only want to look at unsupervised approaches.
I am also interested in creating a large-scale pseudo dataset using an unsupervised approach, where I make sure the aligned sentences preserve the same meanings and sentence pairs with a higher complexity difference are kept.
I hope this pseudo data could improve the performance of my models.
What would be a good way to model sentence complexity in an unsupervised setting and what would be a good way to create such a pseudo dataset?

Working for the law enforcement agency, I plan on building a model that can track social media’s chatter for potential illegal activities involving the selling, acquisition, manufacturing of chemical products, as well as identifying the dissemination of dangerous chemistry knowledge that could be used for illegal activities.
Similar to the idea of building a toxic language classifier to identify cyber bullying, I want to build a classification model that can detect potential illegal activities involving chemistry, possibly by building a synthetic dataset for data augmentation purposes.
To build such a synthetic dataset accurately, I need a large knowledge base for chemistry, so I plan on creating a model to effectively identify trends in chemical literature, extract detailed knowledge about chemical reactions.
The same model could also be used to analyze complex names mentioned in social media chatter, and interpret graphic representations of entities in criminal enterprises, such as buyers, sellers, distributors, enforcers.
Since this system will be used for law enforcement, so it needs to be transparent, therefore, all the classifications and decisions it makes need to contain causal explanations.

One of the limiting factors in training data-driven, rare-event prediction
algorithms is the scarcity of the events of interest resulting in an extreme
imbalance in the data. There have been many methods introduced in the
literature for overcoming this issue; simple data manipulation through
undersampling and oversampling, utilizing cost-sensitive learning algorithms,
or by generating synthetic data points following the distribution of the
existing data. While synthetic data generation has recently received a great
deal of attention, there are real challenges involved in doing so for
high-dimensional data such as multivariate time series. In this study, we
explore the usefulness of the conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN)
as a means to perform data-informed oversampling in order to balance a large
dataset of multivariate time series. We utilize a flare forecasting benchmark
dataset, named SWAN-SF, and design two verification methods to both
quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the similarity between the generated
minority and the ground-truth samples. We further assess the quality of the
generated samples by training a classical, supervised machine learning
algorithm on synthetic data, and testing the trained model on the unseen, real
data. The results show that the classifier trained on the data augmented with
the synthetic multivariate time series achieves a significant improvement
compared with the case where no augmentation is used. The popular flare
forecasting evaluation metrics, TSS and HSS, report 20-fold and 5-fold
improvements, respectively, indicating the remarkable statistical similarities,
and the usefulness of CGAN-based data generation for complicated tasks such as
flare forecasting.

As an environmental researcher, I aim to create a mobile application that uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) to produce personalized, vivid images illustrating the potential impacts of climate change on specific locations.
My plan is to train the GAN on street-view images of horses before and after extreme weather events.
However, since such a dataset does not exist, I require a model capable of learning the 3D structure of an object from images taken from various angles and subsequently rendering an image of the structure from a specified direction.
Furthermore, I intend for the application to incorporate climate models to evaluate the probability and type of long-term climate-related events.
As I am developing a mobile application, I also need techniques to reduce the latency between the mobile device and the backend server, as well as strategies to manage multiple simultaneous calls to the backend server.
Lastly, I am interested in video compression algorithms that can enhance the upload speed and alleviate the storage pressure on the server.
